# color_name-i18n

A ruby translation project (managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) ).

## Objective

When color is used to describe real-world objects that are represented in a computer system, provide a mapping to assist in allowing the color rendered on the screen, the color of a real life object, and the color stated verbally or in writing by different people to map to the same hex color-value. 


## Source for color names

Color names should reflect culturally accepted norms. However, a starting point to use for consistency is to follow the w3c specifications http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-css3-color-20110607/ or color keywords.


## Contributing to color_name-i18n

- Edit the translations directly on the [color_name-i18n](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=color_name-i18n) project on Locale.
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.
